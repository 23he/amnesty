A Hot Key is a keyboard combination that opens or closes the layout at any time, no matter what application is running.</p><p>When the hot key is pressed, the widgets belonging to the current layout (if any) will disappear from the screen and the widgets belonging to this layout will appear in their place.  If this layout is already visible, the hot key will hide the layout.</p><p>Note: Changes made to the Hot Key do not take effect until the next time Amnesty is launched.</p>
	
<b>Display background behind floating widgets</b></p><p>	
When a layout is opened, a background can be displayed directly behind all of its floating widgets.  This can help make the layout more visible by providing contrast against which the widgets are drawn.
<ul>
<p><b>Color</b>.  Click the color swatch to set the color to use for the layout background.</p>
<p><b>Image</b>.  Drag and drop a local image file  into the box to use it as the layout background instead of a color. Press the backspace key to revert to using a color.</p>
<p><b>Opacity</b>.  Use the slider to change the opacity of the layout background: from almost invisible to fully opaque.</p>
</ul>
</p>
<b>Don't save changes made to widget visibility</b></p><p>
If set, the visibility settings of the widgets in the layout will not be affected when a widget is opened or closed in the layout.<p>		This allows you to "lock down" the layout so that everytime it is opened, the same widgets appear.  <p>Note: you'll still be able to open and close widgets, but these actions will not be saved.
